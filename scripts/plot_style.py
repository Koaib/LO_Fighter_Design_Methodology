plot_style.py — applies lo_fighter_paper.mplstyle to every plot this
project generates, so aero/stability/mission/RCS figures all come out
looking like one consistent set (same font, weights, DPI, color cycle,
tick/grid style) instead of each plotting function picking its own
numbers independently.

Import this AFTER matplotlib.pyplot in any script that calls plt.*/
fig.savefig() - importing it is enough, plt.style.use() below takes
effect immediately and applies to every Figure created afterward in
that process:
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import plot_style

See lo_fighter_paper.mplstyle's own header for why it uses matplotlib's
built-in mathtext (mathtext.fontset=cm) instead of a real LaTeX install.
